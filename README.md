## About the Algorithms

This application visualizes three sorting algorithms. Currently, the following ones are included:

* 'Bubble sort' is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through elements, compares adjacent and swaps them if they are in an incorrect order.

* 'Selection sort' algorithm sorts elements by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

* 'Insertion sort' is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

## Built with

* HTML
* CSS
* Material-UI
* React
