## About the Sorting Algorithms

I created this app due to my curiosity for sorting algorithms and their visualization. The following algorithms are included:

1. 'Bubble sort' is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. 'Insertion sort' is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

3. The 'selection sort' algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
